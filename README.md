It's like Venmo, but Solana, but USDC

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies
Follow these directions https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup but skip Creating a new application.

In a terminal in the project directory run `npm install`

Set your environment `JAVA_HOME` to the location of the JRE, e.g. `"C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jre"`

### Starting the App (Windows)
You must have run the setup steps already.

1. In one terminal, run `emulator -avd Pixel_6_Pro_API_33`. Replace `Pixel_6_Pro_API_33` with whatever AVD you are testing with, or if you're
testing on a physical device, get your physical device connected to `abd`.
2. In a second terminal, start Metro: `npx react-native start`. Ignore the shortcut
options that pop up.
3. In a third terminal, deploy the app to the device `npx react-native run-android`.
